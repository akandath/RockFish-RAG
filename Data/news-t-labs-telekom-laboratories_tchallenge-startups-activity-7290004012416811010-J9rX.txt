Meet Rockfish Data - one of the winners of last year's T Challenge, now thriving within Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US' ecosystems.

The American team's success story truly showcases how collaboration can drive AI innovation in telecommunications.

Rockfish's outcome-centric AI platform tackles data silos with synthetic data, enhancing network performance and security. Their groundbreaking solutions, developed through partnerships with Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US, include cross-border data sharing and advanced anomaly detection workflows.

Since its victory at the T Challenge 2024, the team has gone through active Proof-of-Concepts with both telcos. Among other benefits, the T Challenge's spotlight significantly boosted Rockfish's visibility, also leading to a finalist spot for the 4YFN Awards at the Mobile World Congress, supported by hubraum .

While the partnership with Telekom and T-Mobile has helped the startup to scale its platform and position itself at the forefront of AI in telco, Rockfish is also actively contributing to Deutsche Telekom’s AI transformation journey!

Co-Founder MuckAI Girish shared:

“The T Challenge gave us tremendous visibility! It put us on the radar of Deutsche Telekom's teams and shaped our product’s direction. The connections we made were invaluable.”

A special shoutout to Frank van der Rijst and Mohammad Sharifan from Deutsche Telekom for their dedicated mentorship!

During the program, they worked closely with Rockfish's team to pilot three use cases in a live environment, playing a pivotal role in the startup’s continued success. 👏

This year, the T Challenge 2025 continues this legacy, focusing on AI in six areas: network technology, fiber rollout, sustainable power consumption, sales & service, network APIs, and security.

This week marks your final chance to apply - submissions close on January 31st.

Are you ready to create transformative solutions and co-innovate with Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile US?

- Raphael Ouzan Founder & CEO of A.Team 5mo Report this post Tomorrow, I'll be joining leaders from TELUS Global Ventures (TGV) , Hello Alice , and Gunderson Dettmer at The AI Summit Series New York (Dec 11-12), to dig into what we're all discovering: GenAI requires new types of partnerships that go far beyond the traditional vendor-client relationship.

What we've learned building 600+ products with both startups and Fortune 500s this year: The most successful companies aren't just buying AI solutions - they're co-creating them. They're building strategic partnerships that combine their domain expertise with specialized AI talent - creating a model that's delivering custom AI solutions in months, not years.

Why does this matter? Unlike traditional SaaS, GenAI requires deep integration with your unique data, systems, and processes to drive actual value. It's more like assembling custom building blocks than installing packaged software. And with 78% of companies planning to increase AI investment next year, getting this right is critical.

If you're in NYC for the event: Join me, Terry Doyle (TELUS Ventures), Kelsey Ruger (Hello Alice), Joe Green (Gunderson Dettmer), and Olga. Topchaya (Lapis AI) at The AI Accelerator Stage at 1:25 PM on Dec 11 to learn how forward-thinking companies are building these bridges — then come say hi at A.Team ’s booth #129.

If you're a tech leader in NYC and want to attend the AI Summit, shoot me a DM - I might be able to hook you up with a ticket! 50 6 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter To view or add a comment, sign in

- Start2 Group 29,817 followers 6mo Edited Report this post The 𝗔𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺 has officially wrapped up, and we couldn't be prouder of what our cohort accomplished during their time in the Bay Area. From workshops and site visits to fireside chats and networking events, it was a week packed with learning, growth, and connection.

The cohort dove into a series of workshops led by industry experts, covering topics like Silicon Valley culture, Customer Conversations, AI Ethics, and Best Practices for Selling AI Products in the U.S. They also explored the Future of Generative AI at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) and gained hands-on insights into product design and development at SHACK15 in San Francisco’s iconic Ferry Building. Each session was designed to equip the founders with the tools and strategies needed to scale their companies globally.

In addition to the workshops, our participants experienced Silicon Valley firsthand: they toured Databricks , had an inspiring fireside chat with local AI founders at Contextual AI , and connected with peers and investors during happy hours and an AMA session with AI investors. A highlight of the week was their pitch session at TechCrunch Disrupt, where they showcased their innovative AI solutions on a global stage.

Experiencing Silicon Valley up close gave our founders a unique opportunity to engage with the local AI ecosystem, gain valuable insights, and connect with industry peers. Seeing the cutting-edge innovation firsthand inspired new ideas and gave them a renewed sense of clarity and motivation to push their ventures forward.

A huge thank you to our partners at ScaleNL , hub.brussels , and Flanders Investment & Trade (FIT) for joining forces with us to make this program a reality. We can’t wait to see what’s next for these incredible startups!

- Max Kops Stella.Coach | Bestselling Author | (TEDx) Speaker +7years | HR Innovation Award 2024 | Newcomer Award 2023 6mo Edited Report this post 3 takesways from Slush in Helsinki! 

After many days packed with side events and 2 days of the SLUSH itself, these are the conclusions I drew: 

1. It feels like AI is added as the domain ending for every fifth startup. 

2. Many highly successful founders were actually sharing their ideas more focused on #CustomerLove , validation and customer centricity 

3. Regulatory tension is building up, e.g. a participant running a multinational company asked the panelists why his customers all around the same are using the AI tools they provide while EU companies block the AI functionalities of the platform. This is a tangible example of how the world is divided at the moment in terms of AI openness, adoption and regulation. 


Thanks a lot to everyone organizing the German stage as well, which was a fantastic place to network - not only - in the German ecosystem and pitch Stella Coach as world’s first AI coach. ⭐️ Noemi Alvarez Nicola Solomou Dr. Lucas Mittelmeier Vesa Laakso Nic Newman Philippa Köhnk Felix Schroeder Cassandra M.
