Recommender

Uses dataset properties and returns Rockfish actions for the specified
steps.
Parameters:
A DatasetProperties object that stores information about a dataset.
List of steps for which recommended Rockfish actions will be returned. If unspecified, actions will be returned for the following steps: HandleMissingValues, HandleAssociatedFields, ModelSelection.

HandleMissingValues

Handles filling missing values in fields by adding FillNull
(pre-processing) actions.
Parameters:
Maps a dtype to a value that fields with this dtype should be filled with. The dtype should be a pyarrow DataType.

HandleAssociatedFields

Handles merging and splitting associated fields by adding JoinFields
(pre-processing) actions and SplitField (post-processing) actions.
Parameters:
The separator to be used while merging and splitting fields. If unspecified, the default JoinFields/SplitField separator ";" will be used.

HandlePiiFields

Handles anonymizing fields with personally identifiable info (PII)
by adding Transform (pre-processing) actions that remap PII.
Parameters:
Maps a pii_type to the remap type that fields with this pii_type should be transformed using.  The pii_type should be one of the supported PII types = ["DATE_TIME", "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "IP_ADDRESS", "PHONE_NUMBER", "US_SSN", "CREDIT_CARD", "PERSON", "GENERAL_PII"].  The remap type should be one of the supported remap types = ["date", "email", "ip", "phone_number", "ssn", "credit_card", "name", "redact"].  Note that only string fields can be anonymized using "redact" for now.  If any pii_type is unspecified, the default mapping will be used for it.

ModelSelection

Selects a Rockfish model and returns the corresponding Train and
Generate actions.
Parameters:
Rockfish model for which the Train and Generate actions will be returned.
If true, the train dataset's session_key field values are preserved in the synthetic dataset. If false, the session_key field will have session numbers.
