today organizations are not able to
fully use or share the data they have
because of regulatory or policy
restrictions around data use
these data silos can slow down or even
prevent Enterprises from developing
products testing products and
Outsourcing work to third parties
synthetic data is one of the most
exciting Technologies today for getting
around data Cycles
synthetic data allows organizations to
create fake data sets that look like the
real data but aren't
the so-called synthetic data sets are
produced by state-of-the-art generative
Ai and can be shared and used in ways
that real data can't thereby unlocking
the potential of data
some estimates suggest that synthetic
data will comprise as much as 60 percent
of the data used in AI development and
Analytics
but there's a catch
today music synthetic data is hard
meet Alice
Alice is a data scientist at her company
Acme Incorporated where she's in charge
of providing synthetic data to other
divisions within Acme for example she
generates synthetic data for the sales
team to run realistic demos to the
engineering team for testing an incident
response and to other data scientists
for training better AI models
Alice uses an existing synthetic data
tool to train and generate all of these
data sets
this has a problem
sometimes the synthetic data she gets
from her existing tools doesn't look
good for example in a data set of
financial transactions it might
misrepresent the fraction of fraudulent
transactions
when this happens Alice has to waste
time and effort trying to get the
synthetic data to work by changing
configurations
at Rockfish data we believe there's a
better way
building on years of experience working
with synthetic data Enterprise use cases
and Big Data platforms Rockfish provides
a One-Stop synthetic data workbench that
automatically customizes itself to your
data
Rockfish plugs directly into your
existing data ingestion pipelines
automatically chooses the best
representation for your data and trains
your models in the most cost efficient
way possible all while optimizing for
your Downstream use cases
now if Alice decides that the data
doesn't meet her requirements all she
needs to do is indicate how it's
mismatched Rockfish does the rest
now Alice can spend her time on her
other work without wasting time
tinkering with synthetic data models
Rockfish Builds on state-of-the-art
Innovations in generative modeling from
Carnegie Mellon University and deep in
team expertise regarding how to produce
high quality synthetic data while
integrating with high volume
enterprise-grade data streams
