Metrics

We assess the quality of synthetic data both qualitatively through visualizations and quantitatively using metric results.

Distribution Metrics


Correlation Metric

Pearson correlation
- Correlation coefficient between -1 and 1 -1 means perfectly negative linear relationship between two numerical fields 0 means no relationship between two numerical fields 1 means perfectly positive relationship between two numerical fields
- -1 means perfectly negative linear relationship between two numerical fields
- 0 means no relationship between two numerical fields
- 1 means perfectly positive relationship between two numerical fields
- P value: if p value is low (generally <0.05), the correlation coefficient is statistically significant.

Association Metric

CramÃ©r's V
When correction = True , CramÃ©r's V includes bias correction (please refer to this research to understand the bias correction).  When correction=False , bias correction is not applied. By default, bias correction is enabled.
- 0 means no association between two categorical fields
- 1 means perfect association between two categorical fields
