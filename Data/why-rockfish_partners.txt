What our partners say
â Rockfish data has been a great partner to BIMCON helping to generate "synthetic data sets" of Ford Motor Company's product order banks for use in ML Modeling / Simulation. Â Rockfish's GAN models have demonstrated the ability to create synthetic data with characteristics similar to the original dataset, create highly scaled versions of the data and are working to extend the datasets to include content variability, needed to support product futuring analysisâ
