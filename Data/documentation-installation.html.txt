Setup

We recommend using Python >=3.9 to run the Rockfish SDK. This section assumes you are using pip , venv , and macOS/Linux.
Create a fresh virtual environment and activate it:

$ python -m venv rf-venv
$ source rf-venv/bin/activate

Note: You can replace rf-venv here with the virtual environment name of your choice.
Ensure you have the latest version of pip :

$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install the latest version of the Rockfish SDK using pip :

$ pip install -U 'rockfish[labs]' -f 'https://packages.rockfish.ai'


Verification

To check that the Rockfish SDK is installed correctly, you can use one of the following:

$ python -c "import rockfish; print(rockfish.product_version)" $ python -m pip show rockfish
