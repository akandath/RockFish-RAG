Enterprise

The Rockfish Workbench can be deployed in your own datacenter, you need a way
to pull and run OCI or Docker containers.
It can be Kubernetes, systemd, your own solution it does not matter. Let's have a look at the architecture and the various components

Redis

The workbench replays on Redis and its flexibility both as data pipeline (via
Redis Stream) and as metadata store.
Based on capabilities and scales you can deploy two independent Redis (even in
Cluster mode) to scale and operate them independently since they serve two
distinct needs or you can relay on a single installation, this is why we marked
the second one as not requited.

Object Store and SSQL

The Rockfish Workbench solution has a feature called dataset. Dataset are
tables containing the generated value or snapshot of your data you want to
train a model with.
This feature is not mandatory to use because via Data Source the workbench can
do and read data where you have them. Right now we support GCP Storage, AWS S3
and Databricks.
If you need us to storage your data you have to provide an object store to use, it can be:
- AWS S3
- GCP Storage
- Azure Object Store
- MinIO
To read a dataset you can download all of that via HTTP API or you can filter
and query a subset of a dataset via SQL query, to do that we serve a container
called sssql .
