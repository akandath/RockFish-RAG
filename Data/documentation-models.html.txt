Rockfish Models

Rockfish understands the challenge that users face in connecting their high level intents to the actual runnable
algorithms and configurations for the various algorithms. Decisions like when to preprocess or encode the dataset/columns in a specific way to ensure that the
structure is preserved when generating play a critical role in the quality of the generated data.
To dramatically lower the barrier of entry for users and using the naive approach of trying all possible algorithms/configurations can be costly, Rockfish's uses it proprietary Recommendation Engine that analyzes the dataset, fidelity, and privacy requirements of the use case to suggest an appropriate model and model parameters.
Rockfish Platform supports different Gen AI models to support different datasets types:
- Rockfish DoppelGANger (RF-Time-GAN)
- Rockfish REaLTabFormer time-series (RF-Time-Transformer)
- Rockfish REaLTabFormer tabular (RF-Tab-Transformer)
- Rockfish CTGAN (RF-Tab-GAN)

Guidelines for Manual Model selection

For those who want to explore and want to pick the model here are some guidelines:
- Time Series Data: RF-Time-GAN and RF-Time-Transformer models are optimized for time series data, which consist of metadata fields, a timestamp field, and measurement fields. Generally, RF-Time-GAN has a shorter training time compared to RF-Time-Transformer.

- Tabular Data: RF-Tab-GAN and RF-Tab-Transformer are better suited for tabular data, which is a common 2-dimensional dataset.Generally, RF-Tab-GAN has a shorter training time compared to RF-Tab-Transformer.
