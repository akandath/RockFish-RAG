# 🚀 Rockfish RAG Chatbot

This repository contains the foundational pipeline for building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** about Rockfish using data from multiple sources:

✅ Rockfish website  
✅ News articles  
✅ YouTube video transcripts  
✅ Research papers and documentation



## 📂 Project Overview

The chatbot is designed to **answer customer questions** about Rockfish’s mission, products, and insights by combining:

- 🌐 Web scraping and data ingestion  
- ✂️ Text chunking for semantic retrieval  
- 🔍 Dense embeddings and similarity search  
- 📦 ChromaDB as the vector store  
- 🤖 Generative LLMs for natural-sounding answers



## 🟩 Key Steps

1️⃣ **Data Extraction**  
- Scrape and clean text data from multiple sources (website, news, research papers, videos).

2️⃣ **Chunking & Storage**  
- Split data into overlapping chunks to enhance retrieval accuracy.  
- Store chunks in ChromaDB for efficient vector search.

3️⃣ **Dense Retrieval**  
- Generate vector embeddings for each chunk using HuggingFace models.  
- Retrieve top-k relevant chunks to provide context for answers.

4️⃣ **LLM-based Answer Generation**  
- Use retrieved chunks as context for generative LLMs to formulate customer-friendly answers.



## 💡 Use Case
